Revision history for Perl extension Emacs::Lisp and the Perlmacs patch.

0.01  Thu Dec 25 15:57:07 1997
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.18
Lisp functions are autoloaded and exported.  Variables may be explicitly
imported.

0.1  Thu Jan  1 19:43:20  1998
	Can convert between references and Lisp objects.

0.2  Sat Jan  3 19:04:22  1998
	Lisp can specify scalar/list/void context.  Internal memory
management issues mostly worked out, but still very unstable.

0.3  Sun Jan 25 17:19:13  1998
	./configure detects Perl features.  Guts evolving.

0.4  Sat Feb  7 14:33:43  1998
	Most Perl data types can be referenced by Lisp.  Symbols and
typeglobs are equated.  `--perl' as the first command line arg causes
the remaining args to be processed by Perl instead of Emacs.

0.5  Sun Feb  8 19:25:14  1998
	Added setq.  Typeglobs outside of package `main' do not become
symbols.  Much added to pod.  Extensive rework of core C.

0.5.1  Tue Feb 24 20:22:19  1998
	Portability fixes.  Supported perl >= 5.004_50 (at least
without threads).

0.6  Sat Feb 28 20:09:30  1998
	Fixed some core dumps.  Added some new ones.  Various minor
interface tweaks.

0.61  Sun Mar 15 11:30:15  1998
	Split Emacs::Lisp out from the Perlmacs patch distribution.
Added test.pl.

0.79  Thu Mar  4 02:35:36 EST 1999
	Documentation overhaul, plus a temporary kludge to disable
Perlification of Lisp lists.

0.80  Sun Mar  7 01:24:25 EST 1999
	Removed broken Emacs::Lisp::Plist::DELETE.

0.83  
	Update for Perlmacs 0.8.  Leave numbers 0.81 and 0.82 open as
insurance.
	Changed the semantics of argument and return value passing a
bit.  Use the Emacs::Lisp::Object namespace instead of the Emacs::Lisp
namespace for getting genuine, unconverted Lisp objects.
