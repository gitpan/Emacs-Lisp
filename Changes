Revision history for Perl extension Emacs::Lisp and the Perlmacs patch.

0.01  Thu Dec 25 15:57:07 1997
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.18
Lisp functions are autoloaded and exported.  Variables may be explicitly
imported.

0.1  Thu Jan  1 19:43:20  1998
	Can convert between references and Lisp objects.

0.2  Sat Jan  3 19:04:22  1998
	Lisp can specify scalar/list/void context.  Internal memory
management issues mostly worked out, but still very unstable.

0.3  Sun Jan 25 17:19:13  1998
	./configure detects Perl features.  Guts evolving.

0.4  Sat Feb  7 14:33:43  1998
	Most Perl data types can be referenced by Lisp.  Symbols and
typeglobs are equated.  `--perl' as the first command line arg causes
the remaining args to be processed by Perl instead of Emacs.

0.5  Sun Feb  8 19:25:14  1998
	Added setq.  Typeglobs outside of package `main' do not become
symbols.  Much added to pod.  Extensive rework of core C.

0.5.1  Tue Feb 24 20:22:19  1998
	Portability fixes.  Supported perl >= 5.004_50 (at least
without threads).

interface tweaks.
